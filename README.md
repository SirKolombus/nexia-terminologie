## Use the add-in project

## üöÄ Getting Started

The add-in project that you've created contains sample code for a basic task pane add-in.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)## Explore the add-in code

- Microsoft Excel (Desktop or Online)

To explore an Office add-in project, you can start with the key files listed below.

### Installation

- The `./manifest.xml` file in the root directory of the project defines the settings and capabilities of the add-in.  <br>You can check whether your manifest file is valid by selecting **Validate Manifest File** option from the Office Add-ins Development Kit.

1. Clone the repository- The `./src/taskpane/taskpane.html` file contains the HTML markup for the task pane.

```bash- The `./src/taskpane/**/*.tsx` file contains the react code and Office JavaScript API code that facilitates interaction between the task pane and the Excel application.

git clone [repository-url]

cd terminologie-nexia## Troubleshooting

```

If you have problems running the add-in, take these steps.

2. Install dependencies

```bash- Close any open instances of Excel.

npm install- Close the previous web server started for the add-in with the **Stop Previewing Your Office Add-in** Office Add-ins Development Kit extension option.

```

If you still have problems, see [troubleshoot development errors](https://learn.microsoft.com//office/dev/add-ins/testing/troubleshoot-development-errors) or [create a GitHub issue](https://aka.ms/officedevkitnewissue) and we'll help you.  

3. Start development server

```bashFor information on running the add-in on Excel on the web, see [Sideload Office Add-ins to Office on the web](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/sideload-office-add-ins-for-testing).

npm run dev-server

```For information on debugging on older versions of Office, see [Debug add-ins using developer tools in Microsoft Edge Legacy](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/testing/debug-add-ins-using-devtools-edge-legacy).



4. Sideload the add-in in Excel## Make code changes

```bash

npm run start -- desktop --app excelAll the information about Office Add-ins is found in our [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins). You can also explore more samples in the Office Add-ins Development Kit. Select **View Samples** to see more samples of real-world scenarios.

```

If you edit the manifest as part of your changes, use the **Validate Manifest File** option in the Office Add-ins Development Kit. This shows you errors in the manifest syntax.
